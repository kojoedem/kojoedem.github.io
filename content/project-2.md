## Why Ant
While working on my portfolio site, I hit a major bottleneck‚Äîimage sizes were dragging down performance.
A quick test on PageSpeed Insights
 confirmed it: the biggest issue came from large, unoptimized images.

I tried a few online image resize tools, but they kept slowing me down, especially when I needed to resize many images at once.

So, after thinking it through, I decided to create something small, fast, and lightweight to solve the problem.
That‚Äôs how Ant was born. üêú
