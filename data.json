            "Hey Again ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Edem. I believe that Beautiful is better than ugly and Simple is better than complex. Passionate about sharing what I know, I thrive on hard work, perseverance, and, most of all, self-discipline. I love doing what I do and do what I love. I may not be your typical tech guy, but I can tell you a joke about UDPâ€”though you probably wonâ€™t get it. I can also tell you a joke about TCP, and I guarantee you will get it... but it might take a few tries! Oh, and donâ€™t worry, I wonâ€™t 'force-close' our interactionâ€”though I might throw an exception! ðŸ˜‰. In all of this, I am just a simple computer user with an ability to click an icon."
