Passionate about sharing what I know, I thrive on hard work, perseverance, and, most of all, self-discipline. I love doing what I do and do what I love. I may not be your typical tech guy, but I can tell you a joke about UDP—though you probably won’t get it. I can also tell you a joke about TCP, and I guarantee you will get it... but it might take a few tries! Oh, and don’t worry, I won’t 'force-close' our interaction—though I might throw an exception! 😉. In all of this, I am just a simple computer user with an ability to click an icon."
